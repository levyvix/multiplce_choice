# Data Manipulation in CSV format using Python Pandas

This project is a Python Jupyter notebook file that demonstrates how to manipulate a data file in CSV format using the Pandas library. The aim of the project is to create a more readable format by transforming a column with a list of elements into individual keys for each element. The project also demonstrates how to create a new column based on the values of other columns. The project uses the [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) library to manipulate the data. The project uses the [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) to run the Python code.
